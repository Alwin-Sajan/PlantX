        Tomato is a herbaceous sprawling plant growing to 1-3 m in height with weak woody stem. The 
        flowers are yellow in colour and the fruits of cultivated varieties vary in size from cherry 
        tomatoes, about 1â€“2 cm in size to beefsteak tomatoes, about 10 cm or more in diameter. Most 
        cultivars produce red fruits when ripe. Tomato is a native to Peruvian and Mexican region. 
        Though there are no definite records of when and how it came to India , the Portuguese perhaps 
        introduced it to India.</p>

        <p > 
        Tomato is one of the most important "protective foods" because of its special nutritive value. It is 
        one of the most versatile vegetable with wide usage in Indian culinary tradition. Tomatoes are 
        used for soup, salad, pickles, ketchup, puree, sauces and in many other ways It is also used as a 
        salad vegetable. Tomato has very few competitors in the value addition chain of processing.</p>
        <h2>Climate and soil</h2>
        <p>The crop is grown from almost MSL to an altitude of 1500 m in tropical and subtropical regions, 
            with an annual rainfall of 60-150 cm. Very high rainfall during its growth is harmful. When 
            grown under hot weather, it is cultivated as an irrigated crop. The winter crop is planted from 
            August to September. For organic farming of tomato winter crop has been found to be ideal. </p>
        <h2>Land preparation</h2>
        <p>The land may be ploughed and harrowed 3 or 4 times to obtain a fine tilth. About 10 tonnes of 
            Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or vermi compost/compost @ 1-1.5 t per acre is applied at the last 
            ploughing. Green manuring is recommended for areas with assured rainfall and also for irrigated 
            crop. Beds are prepared against the slope and after levelling the bed, field channels of 50 cm 
            breadth are prepared at intervals of 1 m.</p>
